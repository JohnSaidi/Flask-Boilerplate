# Flask-Boilerplate
This command line script provides a quick and easy way to generate a basic Flask web application with a file structure and HTML templates. It can save you time and effort in setting up a new Flask project, especially if you're just getting started with Flask and want to focus on building your application's functionality rather than spending time on the initial setup. Additionally, this boilerplate provides a solid foundation for creating a Flask web application, with the basic routes and templates already in place, making it easier to build upon and customize according to your specific needs
